# Reservoir Computing research Project by Pakkaphon(Max) Prasertsan
A project has been initiated to explore the feasibility of a low-cost neural network that could run on most off-the-shelf machines, such as a personal laptop.

The primary objective of this project is to create a functioning reservoir computing neural network that uses the concept of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Excitatory neurons stimulate the activity of other neurons and are represented as positive weighting in the codes, while inhibitory neurons inhibit the activity of other neurons and are represented as negative weighting in a similar manner to the excitatory. The combination of these two types of neurons is known to be important for the proper functioning of the brain.

Once the network was created, it was tested against complex equations such as the Lorenz-63 and RÃ¶ssler equations. These equations are known for their chaotic behaviour and are often used to test neural network performance. The test results were then analyzed using graphs, and the mean square error values were calculated to determine the network's viability.

The potential implications of this project are significant, as a low-cost neural network that can run on most off-the-shelf machines could be used to improve our understanding of neural networks and not just reservoir computing framework neural networks.
